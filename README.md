# Calculator
Command line calculator.

This calculator is written in C and thus can be compiled into an executable. A minimal Makefile is included to compile with GCC. 

This calculator supports basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. It is not bug free and there are probably some bugs, but none critical that I am aware of.

= Check equality between rvalue and lvalue.
& Check if rvalue and lvalue evaluate to 1 (true).
| Check if rvalue or lvalue evaluate to 1 (true).
! Check if rvalue and lvalue are not equal.

\- minus.
\+ plus.
* multiply.
/ divide.
^ exponent.

The calculator includes true/false macros that evaluate to 1 and 0 respectively.
